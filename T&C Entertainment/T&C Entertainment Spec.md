Text ideas:
_Need to think about a clear value proposition that's focused on your servies/whats different about your service vs. others. Your argument as to why customers should buy from you when they could buy from the competition._

_It can just be the heading as well, subheading isn't required._

A message making it clear that you can handle their situation
- Don't worry. We got this.

Communicate the idea that you can walk their project from inception to delivery
- One stop shop
- From script to screen

Image/video ideas:
_Clear, concise copy is important, but the image can help you tell the story. A good image can form a better argument than trying to write out what they communicate._

_It may be best to leave images somewhat abstract so that there isn't a face/ or distracting focal point_

A situation or setting that they are familiar with
 - a desk with computer, coffee, papers, planner, something along those lines
A person or situation they would like to be
 - someone on set, watching cameras roll or doing something that obvivously comes after getting financed/funded

## Services/Specialty
----
Need to appeal to both the logical and the emotional parts of the psyche here. This area should tell the user not only what you do, but plenty of consulting firms will likeyly offer similar services. You want to communicate why having __you__ do it is important/what it is that you contribute beyond the paperwork.

In addition to producing our own content we specialize in creating luxury pitch packages artfully designed to represent the script or project. __In support of new film makers wanting to sell their first films__, we offer flexible payment options and valuable insight regarding the best way to present a new project to investors. Contact us to find out about our prices and designs.
_This is probably an important part. Even if a lot of production consultants do it, it's worth finding the language to say it publicly. Need to speak more about how you work with first-time film makers and those projects that have more modest budgets._


## About/People
----
_Getting a new version of this._
_Might be worthwhile to split this up._
_Haven't decided on whether or not to put up pictures yet._
T&C Entertainment is a Los Angeles based production company offering consulting for business plans, pitch packages, and production for TV and films.â€‹
