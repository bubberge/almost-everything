<p><span class="hide-for-medium">I'm Amy, </span>I am a former fire-twirler and ski bum, current outdoor crazy-person and adventure mama! I live in Seattle with my designer/developer husband (um, he made this awesome website!) and sweet baby boy.</p>
<p>I am happiest when I am capturing natural, emotion-driven images. There is a unique energy present in laughter, intimacy, and love. I look for those moments.</p>
<p>I believe photos are more than just a way to remind you what you looked like or who you were with the day that they were taken. They're meant to tell a story, where each frame has the power to transport you back in time, to that exact moment.</p>
