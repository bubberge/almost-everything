              <p>I find that I am most proud of the things I accomplish while following these principles:</p>
              <span><span>Keep Learning:</span> Web development has so many disciplines, and it can be self-taught. I can't think of a better combination for me.</span>
              <span><span>Spontaneity Can Be Good:</span> In 2009 I moved to Wyoming just to snowboard. Jobs I had there laid the groundwork for pursuing web develoment.</span>
              <span><span>Be Yourself:</span> I think armor costumes are cool, <a target="_blank" href="http://imgur.com/a/D7oUQ#0" title="photo gallery [imgur] of my self-made Halo 3 MJOLNIR Mark VI suit">so I made one.</a></span>
