              <p>In High School I kind of kicked off my interest in web development with an Adobe Flash class, which was actually a cool technology at the time. I did some e-Commerce marketing stuff in the DECA program as well.</p>
              <span><span>Flash:</span> basic web design concepts, animation keyframing, that sort of thing</span>
              <span><span>e-Com Marketing:</span> learned how to fill out a job application without making a grammatical error</span>

              <p>I was a European Studies major at UW, so my web dev EXP in college consisted of adding the HTML for a Top 16 to my MySpace account. The concepts were valuable, and so was my minor: French.</p>
              <span><span>European Studies:</span> learned about organizational super-structures, inheriting properties (laws)</span>
              <span><span>French:</span> language-learning techniques ended up being pretty useful later on</span>

              <p>Worked for a guy that had a thing for starting e-Commerce stores. I ran everything for all of them, from answering customer service phone calls to helping with two site re-designs.</p>
              <span><span>GoSkateShop:</span> hands-on work with Flash, Adobe Creative Suite, e-Commerce management, and lots of customer service</span>

              <span><span>Customer Service:</span> refined that ever-important ability to explain technical subject matter to non-technical persons</span>

              <h2>Outside Work</h2>
              <p>I get pretty bored if I'm not challenging myself with something new and difficult to focus on. The things I am proudest of all follow that mold.</p>
              <span><span>Snowboarding:</span>In 2009 I moved to Jackson, WY just to snowboard. Inadvertently, the jobs that I had there laid the groundwork for pursuing web develoment.</span>
              <span><span>Halo Suit:</span>I think armor costumes are cool. Like a true DIY enthusiast, I watched about 2 minutes of a YouTube video and figured <br class="show-for-medium">I could make one too. Surprisingly, <a target="_blank" href="http://imgur.com/a/D7oUQ#0" title="photo gallery [imgur] of my self-made Halo 3 MJOLNIR Mark VI suit">I did.</a></span>
              <span><span>Web Develoment:</span>The world of webdev is basically endless, and it can be self-taught. It may seem strange because web development is work for so many people, but it's actually a perfect match for me.</span>
              <span><span>If you read all of that,</span>It's probably time to look at<a href="portfolio"> my portfolio.</a></span>
